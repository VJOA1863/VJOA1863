Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I hold a **Master’s in Commerce**, an **MBA**, and a **Master’s in Data Science & Business Analytics**, along with **2 years of experience as an Associate Business Analyst** equipping me with a unique blend of business acumen and advanced analytical skills. My passion lies in leveraging data analytics and business intelligence to solve complex problems across industries and drive impactful decision-making.

Here, you’ll find projects where I:
- **Transform raw data into actionable insights** using tools like Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.
- **Apply predictive modeling, machine learning, and statistical analysis** to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Design data-driven solutions** for real-world business challenges, from optimizing operations to enhancing customer experiences.

I believe data is the most abundant yet underutilized resource in the world, and I’m committed to harnessing its power to solve not only business problems but also everyday life challenges.

I’m currently learning Advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning. I’m also sharpening my skills in Python, R, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.
